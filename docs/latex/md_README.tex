Tool\-D\-A\-Q is an open source general modular D\-A\-Q Frame\-Work, with built in service discovery.



 \#\-Concept 



The main executable creates a \hyperlink{classToolChain}{Tool\-Chain} which is an object that holds Tools. Tools are added to the \hyperlink{classToolChain}{Tool\-Chain} and then the \hyperlink{classToolChain}{Tool\-Chain} can be told to Initialise Execute and Finalise each tool in the chain.

The \hyperlink{classToolChain}{Tool\-Chain} also holds a uesr defined \hyperlink{classDataModel}{Data\-Model} which each tool has access too and can read ,update and modify. This is the method by which data is passed between Tools.

User Tools can be generated for use in the tool chain by incuding a \hyperlink{classTool}{Tool} header. This can be done manually or by use of the new\-Tool.\-sh script.
